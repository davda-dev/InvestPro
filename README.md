DBMS Project
The project titled InvestPro is a database management system inspired by leading fintech stock trading platforms. It is divided into three main sections: the user section tracks individual details, holdings, and watchlists; the company section stores company information such as stock performance and financial metrics; and the trading details section manages transaction history, order execution, and brokerage fees.
